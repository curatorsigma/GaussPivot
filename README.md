# GaussPivot
Showcasing of Errorbehaviour in 2x2 Gaussian Algorithm using Rowpivoting

## Input
Are a 2x2 Matrix (A) and a 2(x1) Vector (b). The Equation solved for x is

Ax=b.

## Algorithm
- The identical Gaussian Algorithm is applied to both the original matrix A|b and a Matrix where
the first and second row may be swapped such that A_11 is greater then A_21.
- Decimal Precicion is limited to 4 decimals.
- Arithmetic is entirely based on python3.7s decimal module.

## Results
The resulting solutions for the pivoted as well as for the unpivoted System A|b are given as output.
